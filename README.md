I optimized the entire setup into one node, with all the necessary parameters easily accessible to the user.

# Compatibility 🧩

This tornado effect works for both **Eevee** and **Cycles**, and was tested in **Blender 4.4/5.0**.

# Enhancement ✨

You can achieve better results by adjusting the **Volume** settings.

## Eevee
- Change the **Resolution** to **1:2** (or whatever you like);
- Disable the **Custom Range** option to avoid clipping the tornado.

## Cycles
- Enable **Biased** option;
- Decrease the **Step Rate Render** and **Viewport** to **0.10** (or whatever you like).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _Technically, you can apply this Shader to any object. However, I strongly recommend using the geometry shown above, since it already carries the tornado look._ <br>
> _If you scale it or apply the Shader to a different object, you’ll likely need to re‑adjust the settings from scratch._

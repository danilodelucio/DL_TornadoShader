# Compatibility 🧩

This tornado effect works for both **Eevee** and **Cycles**, and was tested in **Blender 4.4/5.0**.

# Enhancement ✨

You can achieve better results by adjusting the **Volume** settings.

## Eevee
- Change the **Resolution** to **1:2** (or whatever you like);
- Disable the **Custom Range** option to avoid clipping the tornado.

- Decrease the **Step Rate Render** and **Viewport** to **0.10** (or whatever you like).
